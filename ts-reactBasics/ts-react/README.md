# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

# TypesScript with React AddOn

## Task

The task is to create a basic React application for random users. You'll be working towards the `https://randomuser.me/api/` api that will return a random user (you can fetch directly from your frontend this time).

- The UI should display at least the users `address`, `age` and `name`.
- It should also be possible to change the name through a form input (but you don't have to make a post request, just simply update the name in the UI.)
  - in other words, make it possible to change the state of the name field.
- For each new load of the application, a new user should appear.

## Goal

The goal of this lab is to get familiar with TypeScript in React. Make sure to read the documentation to get to know the pre-existing types supplied by React. The lab is quite basic so practice applying TypeScript as much as possible, including `useState`, `useEffect`, `props` to mention a few.

When you're finished, check out a suggested solution on the solution branch if you want.
